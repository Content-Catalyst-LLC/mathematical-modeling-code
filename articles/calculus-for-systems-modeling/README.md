# Calculus for Systems Modeling

Companion repository folder for the **Calculus for Systems Modeling** article map and nested article-level workflows.

This folder supports calculus-based systems modeling across continuous change, functions, variables, mathematical representation, domains, ranges, valid input spaces, infinity, infinitesimals, limits, approximation, rates, accumulation, optimization, differential equations, numerical methods, sensitivity analysis, responsible interpretation, and reproducible scientific-computing workflows.

## Nested article folders

Article-specific code lives under:

```text
articles/calculus-for-systems-modeling/articles/
```

Current active article companion folders:

```text
articles/calculus-for-systems-modeling/articles/what-is-calculus-for-systems-modeling/
articles/calculus-for-systems-modeling/articles/functions-variables-and-mathematical-representation/
articles/calculus-for-systems-modeling/articles/domains-ranges-and-the-structure-of-functional-models/
articles/calculus-for-systems-modeling/articles/infinity-infinitesimals-and-the-historical-problem-of-change/
```

## Advanced mathematical standard

All active article folders now include an `advanced/` layer designed for mathematically mature readers. Future articles should include:

- formal mathematical deepening sections;
- definitions, propositions, counterexamples, and boundary cases;
- codomain/image/range distinctions where relevant;
- feasible sets, invariant sets, and state spaces where relevant;
- convergence, stability, conditioning, and numerical-error notes where computation is involved;
- stronger tests beyond smoke checks;
- generated Markdown/JSON audit reports.

The standard is documented in:

```text
docs/advanced-mathematical-article-standard.md
shared/advanced_standard/advanced_code_standard.md
```

## Default article folder structure

Each nested article folder may include:

```text

sql/
haskell/
c/
cpp/
fortran/

github-embed-wordpress.html
```

## General principles

- Keep models transparent.
- Make assumptions explicit.
- Separate synthetic teaching data from real-world datasets.
- Document parameters, uncertainty, and limitations.
- Use reproducible workflows.
- Treat computation as support for interpretation, not a substitute for judgment.
- Keep examples educational, auditable, extensible, and mathematically credible.

## Run smoke checks

```bash
make smoke
```

## Run advanced checks

```bash
make advanced
```
